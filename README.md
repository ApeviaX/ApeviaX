- 👋 Hi, I’m @ApeviaX
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things and therefore I have more hobbies than I can manage :p
My biggest interests/hobbies are Garderning, Aquaristic, Tech, Hi-Fi & Photography as well as enjoying a good beer, whiskey etc. with a good friend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web development and basic Python. I am also experimenting with Linux as a secondary OS, and have done so in a few years time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, nothing just yet but in the future... who knows ;)
- 📫 How to reach me, as for know I do unfortunatley don't have much spare time for additional contact. But in the future via e-mail and DM. I'll post the info. when ready.
